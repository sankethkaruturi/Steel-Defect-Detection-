# Steel-Defect-Detection-
ðŸ”© Predicting the likelihood of defects in steel can be highly valuable for taking preventive measures during manufacturing and construction. In this machine learning project, we work with annotated images of steel to detect and classify defects, aiming to enhance quality control and ensure the reliability of steel used across various applications.
